We created a perceptron object and trained it to the array of samples we made.  We then had the program write a "perceptron" text file which saved the weights of each perceptron by row.  We had it read the contents of this text file to assign the weights.  Next we used getSquares to read the user's letter as 0's and 1's for each square and checked it to see if it matched the letter we chose.  We had to make sure that the neural network was recognizing unique letters and not creating two different cases of the same letter.  We used an array to store the unique letters and boolean checks to make sure they were unique.  We then turned the perceptron into an array to account for all of the unique letters and had them read off the different parts of the text files storing the weights and the letter values based on its location in the array.  Finally, we had the neural network sort through all the perceptrons to find the one with the highest weight given the test input to guess which letter was being written.  It all worked very well and very often guesses the correct letter.
